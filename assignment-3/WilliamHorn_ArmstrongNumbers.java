 * they entered is an armstrong number (the sum of cubed digits)
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input -> 123
 * Output -> 123 IS NOT an armstrong number
 * 
 * Input -> 153
 * Output -> 153 IS an armstrong number
 *

 * Aside:
 * 
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 * 
 * This comment block contains personal notes written by me, Will Horn, for the purpose of
 * referencing at some arbitrary point in the future. All notes are relevant within the
 * context of the assignment. These notes are NOT stolen, copied, or plagarized, nor is any 
 * code or otherwise. 
 * 
 * In general, you can represent the sum of cubed digits for any number n,
 * such that n satisfies:
 * 
 *    n = Î£ (k=0; floor(log10(n))) { (floor(|n/10^k|) mod 10)^3 }
 * 
 * This makes sense, as it is close in part with the "sum of digits" problem
 * from the last assignment. The shared engine between the two problems is the 
 * mathematical parsing of digits using the mod function, where:
 * 
 *    mod(a, b) = a - b(floor(|a/b|))
 * 
 * It's interesting to note that the mod function itself is a form of digit parsing,
 * or truncation. So, the general sequence of digits of a number can be expressed as:
 * 
 *    (a_k)(k=floor(log10(n)); 0) = floor(|n/10^k|) mod 10
 * 
 * In this case, the sequence begins for the digits from left to right. 
 * 
 * --------------------------------
 * - Finding Any Armstrong Number -
 * --------------------------------
 * 
 * It may be possible that one could find any armstrong number, given some 
 * starting digit n (where n is the significant digit), by creating a system of equations 
 * to narrow down the possible solutions.
 * 
 * For example, given a 3-digit number n, it can be broken down into:
 * 
 *    n = a*10^2 + b*10^1 + c*10^0
 * 
 * We know that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = n, so:
 * 
 *    a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = a*10^2 + b*10^1 + c*10^0
 *    => b^3 + c^3 = 100*a - a^3
 *    => b^3 + c^3 = a(100 - a^2)
 *    => c^3 = a(100 - a^2) + b(10 - b^2)
 *    => a(100 - a^2) + (10*b - b^2) + c(1 - c^2) = 0
 * 
 * This may or may not lead to an interesting pattern, although I think one does exist regardless.
 * 
 * Note to self: do more research on this later, and try to prove what the
 * largest armstrong number is for a fixed number of digits.
